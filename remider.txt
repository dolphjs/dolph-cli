there are two types  of projects: 
and the large only that supports the CLI options

- the large and
- the small

- fix error resulting if a file exists already and also make it possible to create a directory if it doesn't exist
- remove the folder after configs folder

remeber to add  a general generate command to take one name and use it for [routes. model. controllers & services]


update to cli-colors or chalk

In the future, one config file should do, chnage directry name to something liek this: user.controller.ts
