there are two types  of projects: 

- the large and
- the small

- fix error resulting if a file exists already and also make it possible to create a directory if it doesn't exist

- fix error that makes functional programming mic with oop template for routes/index

- remove the folder after configs folder

and the large only that supports the CLI options

update to cli-colors or chalk

In the future, one config file should do, chnage directry name to something liek this: user.controller.ts
